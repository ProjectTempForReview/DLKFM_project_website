## Abstract

 We develop a deep learning pipeline to accurately align challenging multimodality images. The method is based on traditional Lucas-Kanade algorithm with feature maps extracted by deep neural networks. We test our method on three datasets, MSCOCO with regular images, Google Earth with cross season images, Google Map and Google Satellite with multimodality images.
